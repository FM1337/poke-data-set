# Poke Data Set
Just a bunch of dataset stuff related to Pokemon that I needed for my various projects I work on.

## Stuff
### available-pokemon.json
This [file](available-pokemon.json) contains a JSON list of all Pokemon (not including their forms because I'm lazy and haven't got to that part yet) with the the following information:
1. Name
2. Pokedex Number
3. The list of generations the Pokemon is available in (not necessarily meaning "catchable", but actual exist in game and can be transferred to the game)
